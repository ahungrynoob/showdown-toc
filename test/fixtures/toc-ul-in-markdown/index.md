It was a nice day.

### Part 2
There were stormy clouds on the horizon.

They were very dark.

Then it rained.

#### Part 2A
Notice this heading isn't in the contents above. We only index the top level headings in each section, to keep things tidy. You may or may not like this, but that's the way it is. If you want to create a pull request with an option, you're welcome to! :)

The End.
